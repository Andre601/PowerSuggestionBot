# PowerSuggestion (PowerSupport)

## For what is that bot?
PowerSuggestion, also known as PowerSupport, is a Bot for the [PowerPlugins-Server](https://powerplugins.net)!
It is the first Bot from Andre_601, that is made in JDA.

## Can I use the code?
Yes. The code is public domain (No copyright). You can use it for yourself.
But the code isn't the best (Andre_601 is no Pro with JDA or Java at all) so be carefull when using it.
